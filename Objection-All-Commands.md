### **üí° How to Discover More?**  
1. **Check Frida‚Äôs API**: Objection wraps Frida, so some features come from Frida itself.  
   - Example: `android heap dump` ‚Üí Uses Frida‚Äôs `Memory.scan()`.  
2. **Use `help <command>`**: Some commands have hidden options.  
   ```bash
   help android hooking watch method
   ```  
3. **Read the Source**: Objection‚Äôs [GitHub](https://github.com/sensepost/objection) has the full command list.

### **üöÄ Final Notes**  
- **Not all commands work on every app** (depends on protections).  
- **Combine with Frida scripts** for advanced hacking (e.g., hooking native code).  
- **Updates**: New commands are added in newer versions.
